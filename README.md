# Machine-Learning-Data-Analysis

This project aims to compare six widely used classification methods: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Gradient Tree Boosting. These methods will be tested on a binary classification problem involving candidates for exoplanets discovered by NASA's Kepler space probe.

An exoplanet is a planet located outside of our solar system, meaning it does not orbit the Sun. The Kepler spacecraft first identifies signals of potential exoplanets, known as Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI). However, not all KOIs are actual exoplanets; some are false positives of various origins. Your task is to classify the KOIs as either confirmed exoplanets or false positives.

Each observation corresponds to a KOI, and the features represent estimated characteristics of each (potential) exoplanet, such as size, temperature, features of the host star, and more.

Feel free to explore the source code and the obtained results. The documentation is organized in specific folders for each classification method, facilitating the understanding and replication of the experiments.
